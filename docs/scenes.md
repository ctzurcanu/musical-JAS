# Scene 1.2 Lyrics
```
NAPOLEON

I dreamed I met a maid from France;
A most inspiring soul.
She had that look you seldom see:
The fearless, yet restrained.
I asked her what compelled her be,
How her story begun.
I questioned her, she said no word,
As if in other world.
And next, the room was full of stern and armored men,
They seemed in awe of her.
They knelt and then
They vanished once again.
Then I saw legions upon legions,
Cheering for this one maid.
And then I heard them chant my name,
As if our fates were braid.

Hey Joan, Joan won't you lead us on?
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!
Vive Maid of Orléans!

Pierre Cauchon

Tell courtroom to be silent, we foresee a threat quite violent.
This common host, has much too boast.
Tell these men who sing your praise, that they are fools and out of phase.
They're not on the course, the Church will likely endorse.

FOLLOWERS

Vive Jeanne!
Hey Jeanne, Jeanne, Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!
Hey Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!
Hey Joan, Joan, you're a Saint, our Saint-to-be!
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!
Hey Maid of Orléans!

Joan of Arc

Why squander words rebuking this crowd?
Nothing can hush their voices, loud.
If every man were silenced here,
The sky and earth themselves would cheer.

FOLLOWERS and Joan of Arc

Vive Jeanne!
Hey Jeanne, Jeanne, Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!
Hey Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

Hey Joan, Joan, won't you fight for France?
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne, Hey Maid of Orléans!

Joan of Arc

Sing me your hymns,
But not just for me, do sing.
Sing out for France,
For you are blessed.
There's not one here
Who cannot win a soul.
The meek, the brave,
The living and the saved.

# Scene 1.4 Lyrics
```
KING CHARLES VII

My mind is clearer now,
At last all too well
I can see where France will soon will be.
If you strip away the myth from the maid,
You will see where we all soon will be. Joan!
You've started to believe
The things they say of you.
You really do believe
This voice of Saints is true.
And all the good you've done
Will soon get swept away.
You've begun to matter more
Than voices you obey.

Listen Joan, I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember, I've been your king all along.
You have kindled their zeitgeist.
They think they've found a Jesus Christ.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of saints then, we called you a girl.
And believe me, my support for you hasn't unfurled.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.
Domrémy, your famous daughter should have stayed a shepherdess
Like her father tending sheep, she'd have made good.
Fields, farms, and rural charms would have suited Joan best.
She'd have caused nobody harm; no one would have been distressed.

Listen, Joan, do you care for our France?
Don't you see we must keep in our stance?
We are occupied; have you forgotten how down-trodden we are?

I am frightened by the crowd.
For they are getting much too loud.
And they'll crush us if you go too far.
If they go too far....

Listen, Joan, to the warning I give.
Please know that I want us to convive.
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour.
All your followers are blind,
Too much sainthood on their minds.
It was beautiful, but now it's sour.
Yes, it's all gone sour.

Listen, Joan, to the warning I give.
Please know that I want you to live.
C'mon, c'mon,
She won't listen to me...
C'mon, c'mon,
She won't listen to me...

```
FOLLOWERS

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
Don't disturb me now, I can see the answers
'Till this evening is this morning, life is fine.
Always hoped that I'd be of service.
Knew that I would earn it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can chant of Orleans,
So they'll still talk about us et la France.

JOAN

The end... is just a little harder, when brought about by our liege.
For all you care, your deeds could be my blood.
For all you care, your gifts to each other could be my body.
The end! It is my blood you act.
It is my body you give.
If you would remember me when you serve and donate.
I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered.
Yes, I must be out of my head.
Look at your blank faces. My name will mean nothing
Ten minutes after I'm dead.
The Church denies me.
One of you betrays me.

FOLLOWERS

No! Who would?! Impossible!

JOAN

The Church will deny me in just a few days.
With many more tailling,
And that's not all I see.
One of you here dining,
One of France's chosen
Will move to betray me.

KING CHARLES VII

Cut the dramatics!
You know very well who.

JOAN

Why don't you go do it?

KING CHARLES VII

You want me to do it!

JOAN

Hurry, English are waiting.

KING CHARLES VII

If you knew why I do it

JOAN

I don't care why you do it!

KING CHARLES VII

To think I admired you.
Well now I deny you.

JOAN

You liar. You Judas.

KING CHARLES VII

You want me to do it!
What if I man and supply you again?
And ruined your ambition.
Christ you deserve it.

JOAN

Hurry, you fool. Hurry and go.
Save me your speeches,
I don't want to know. Go!

FOLLOWERS

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
What's that in the bread? It's gone to my head,
'Till this morning is this evening, life is fine.
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll all talk about us when we've died.

KING CHARLES VII

You sad, pathetic maid, see what you make me do,
We lost city of Paris and all because of you.
But the unkingly part of all:
I need to turn you in.
Like a common criminal, like the traitor you could be.
A Retired Victor,
A Victor baddly tired,
Like a retired, tired, tired and retired, chef de guerre à la retraite

JOAN

English are waiting! Get out!
They're waiting, Oh, waiting my king's betrial!

KING CHARLES VII

Every time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.
You'd have managed better if you'd follow what I planned...
Oh....

FOLLOWERS

Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll still talk about us when we've died.

JOAN

Will no one pray with me?
Soldiers, Priests, Frenchmen?
Will none of you burn with me?
Soldiers, Priests, Frenchmen?

# Scene 1.6 Lyrics
```
JOAN

I only wish to say,
If there’s a way,
Keep the flames away from me,
For I am weaker than this torment.
Feel it burn me,
I have changed.
Once I heard voices, clear and sparkling.
Then, I was chosen.
Now, I’m trapped and poisoned.
Listen, surely I've met Heaven's expectations,
Fought one long year, seemed like twenty.
Has Jesus asked as much from any other soul?
But if I burn,
See my path through and keep my standard true,
Let them mock me, scorn me, chain me, tie me to the flames.
I want to know, I want to know, dear Jesus,
Want to know, I want to know, good Jesus,
Want to see, I want to see, dear Saints,
Want to see, I want to see, good Saints,
Why must I burn?
Will my name shine brighter than it ever has before?
Will all the hearts which moved beat same drum evermore?
I need to know, I need to know, dear Jesus,
Need to know, I need to know, good Jesus,
Need to see, I need to see, dear Saints,
Need to see, I need to see, good Saints,
If I am ash what will then be my crown?
If I am ash what will then be my crown?
Need to know, I need to know, dear Jesus,
I need to know, I need to know, good Jesus,
Why must I burn? Oh, why must I burn?
Can you tell me now my dust won't be forgotten?
Show me just a fragment of your grand celestial plane.
Show me there's a reason for my toils and my pain.
You've chosen me for grilling and tasked Rouen for embers.
Alright, I'll burn!
Just watch me burn!
See how I burn!
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah
See how I burn!

Back then I was chosen,
Now, I'm trapped and poisoned.
After all, I've tried for one year, seems like always.
Angel Michael, for The Throne, your white standard I've flown
In Rouen's fiery dawn, I'll burn for Christ, alone.
Heaven, your purpose is vast,
But in you, my trust is cast.
I'll wear your garb, accept my past.
Take me to your stake, Rouen.
Burn me, light me,
End me.
Take me, now!
Before my heart gives up.
```

# Scene 1.6 Lyrics [Fr]

```
JEANNE

Je veux seulement dire,
S'il existe un moyen,
Éloignez de moi ces flammes,
Car je suis plus faible que ce tourment.
Sentez-le me brûler; j'ai changé.

Jadis, j'entendais des voix, claires et brillantes. 
Puis, j'ai été choisie.
Maintenant, je suis piégée et empoisonnée.
Écoute, sans doute j'ai rempli les vœux du Ciel,
Un an de combat, me semble vingt.
Jésus a-t-il demandé autant d'une autre âme?

Mais si je brûle,
Voyez la saga et maintenez mon étendard,
Qu'ils me raillent, me méprisent, m'enchaînent, m'attachent aux flammes.

Je veux savoir, je veux savoir, doux Christ,
Je veux savoir, je veux savoir, cher Christ,
Je veux voir, je veux voir, doux Saints,
Je veux voir, je veux voir, chers Saints,
Pourquoi dois-je brûler?
Mon nom brillera-t-il plus que jamais?
Les cœurs qui se sont émus battront-ils au même rythme?
Je veux savoir, je veux savoir, doux Christ,
Je veux voir, je veux voir, cher Christ,
Je veux voir, je veux voir, doux Christ,
Je veux voir, je veux voir, chers Saints,
Je veux voir, je veux voir, doux Saints,
Si je suis cendre, que sera alors ma couronne?
Si je suis cendre, que sera alors ma couronne?
Je dois savoir, je dois savoir, doux Christ,
Je dois savoir, je dois savoir, doux Christ, Pourquoi devrais-je brûler?
Pourquoi devrais-je brûler?
Pouvez-vous me dire que ma poussière ne sera pas oubliée?
Montrez-moi un fragment de votre vaste plan céleste. 
Montrez-moi qu'il y a une raison à mes peines et mes douleurs.
Vous m'avez choisie pour le gril, et Rouen pour les braises.
Très bien!
Regarde-moi brûler!

Vois comme je brûle!
Vois comme je brûle!
oh oh oh oh!
Vois comme je brûle!

Jadis, j'étais choisie,
Maintenant, je suis piégée et empoisonnée.
Après tout, j'ai essayé pendant un an, ça me semble pour toujours.
Michel, pour le Trône, ton étendard blanc j'ai porté,
Dans l'aube incendiaire de Rouen, je brûlerai pour le Christ, seule.
Dieu, votre volonté est dure, mais vous détenez toutes les cartes.
Je porterai votre habit; j'accepte mon passé. 
Emmenez-moi à ton bûcher, Rouen.
Brûlez-moi, allumez-moi,
Mettez fin à moi
Prenez-moi maintenant!
Avant que mon cœur ne lâche.

# Scene 1.7 Lyrics
```
CAUCHON

We've been sitting on the fence for far too long.

D'ESTIVET

Why let her upset us?
Cauchon, let her be.
All those imbeciles will see,
She really doesn't matter.

CAUCHON

Joan is important,
We've let her go her way before.
And while she starts the revolution,
We theorize and chatter.

D'ESTIVET

She's just another scripture thumping hack from France.

CAUCHON

The difference is they call her a Saint,
This difference frightens me!
What about the Church?
When they see a new Christ crowned,
Do you think they'll stand around,
Cheering, and applauding?
What about our cardinals?
If they see we've lost our nerve,
Don't you think that they deserve,
Something less challenging.

D'ESTIVET

They've got what they want,
They think so, anyway.
If she's what they want,
Why take their toy away?
She's a craze!

CAUCHON

Put yourself in my place,
I can hardly step aside.
Can not let my hands be tied.
I am law and order.
What about our priesthood?
Don't you see that we could fall?
If we are to last at all,
We can not be divided.

D'ESTIVET

Then say so to the council,
But don't rely on subtlety.
Let English scare them, or they won't see.

CAUCHON

Then we are decided?

D'ESTIVET

Then we are decided.

# Scene 1.8 Lyrics
```
KING CHARLES VII

Now if I help you, it matters that you see
These sordid kinda things are coming hard to me.
It's taken me some time to work out what to do.
I weighed the whole thing out before I came to you.
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm ... damned for all time.
I came because I had to; I'm the one who saw.
Jesus can't control it like he did before.
And furthermore I know that Joan thinks so too.
Joan wouldn't mind that I was here with you.
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm ... damned for all time.
Burgundians, you're friends, worldly men and wise.
Cauchon, my friend, I know you sympathize.
Why are we the prophets? Why are we the ones
Who see the sad solution - know what must be done?
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm damned for all time.

BURGUNDIANS

Cut the protesting, forget the excuses.
We want information. Get up of the floor.

CAUCHON

We have the papers we need to arrest him.
You know his movements. We know the canon law.

BURGUNDIANS

Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded.

CAUCHON

We'll pay you in silver, cash on the nail.
We just need to know where the soldiers can find her.

BURGUNDIANS

With no armies around her.

CAUCHON

Then we can't fail.

KING CHARLES VII

I don't want your blood money!

CAUCHON

Oh, that doesn't matter, our expenses are good.

KING CHARLES VII

I don't need your blood money!

BURGUNDIANS

But you might as well take it. We think that you should.

CAUCHON

Think of the things you could do with that money,
Choose any charity - give to the poor.
We've noted your motives.
We've noted your feelings.
This isn't blood money - it's a ...

BURGUNDIANS

A fee.

CAUCHON

A fee nothing more.

KING CHARLES VII

On Tuesday morning you'll find her where you want her.
Far from her army, tired, locked out of gates of Compiégne.

BURGUNDIANS

Well done Sire. Good old Charles.

Hang on, Joan,
We're going to fight for you! (Repeat)

It was nice, but now it's gone.
Why are you obsessed with fighting?
Stick to treaties from now on.

Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Do you think that you may retire?
Did you think you would get much higher?
How do you view your coming trial?
Have your men proved at all worth while?
Come with us to see Cauchon.
You'll just love Rouen's courthouse.
You'll just love seeing Cauchon.
You'll just burn in the marketplace.
Come on God this is not like you.
Let us know what you're going to do.
You know what you're supporters feel;
You'll escape in the final reel.
Tell me Joan how you feel tonight.
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Come with us to see Cauchon.
You'll just love Rouen's courthouse.
You'll just love seeing Cauchon.

Joan, you must realize the serious charges facing you.
You say you're you hear voices of Saints in all your posts,
Well, is it true?

JOAN

That's what you say, you say that I hear.

There you have it gentlemen.
What more evidence do we need?

CHURCH ACTOR ONE

Most Reverend Cauchon, the courtroom waits your grace.
The theologians and clerics are here for the case.

CAUCHON

Ah gentlemen, you know our task in Rouen,
We've not much time, and big ask from Paris, London, Rome.

FRENCH ARMY (outside)

Vive la Vierge Jeanne! Long live Supermaiden!
Vive la Pucelle! Our Savioress!
Vive la Vierge Jeanne! Long live Supermaiden!
Vive la Pucelle! Our Savioress!

D'ESTIVET

Listen to that clamor, of peasants in the street!
A maid lifts up a banner, and they fall at her feet.

ALL (inside)

She is dangerous!

FRENCH ARMY (outside)

Joan of Arc, Our Savioress!

ALL (inside)

She is dangerous!

FRENCH ARMY (outside)

Tell us that you are 
who we say that you are.

CHURCH ACTOR TWO

The Maid is in the tower, she will appear in court.

CHURCH ACTOR THREE

Her rabble-rousing mission 
we are tasked to abort.

ALL (inside)

She is dangerous!

FRENCH ARMY (outside)

Joan of Arc, Our Savioress!

ALL (inside)

She is dangerous!

CHURCH ACTOR TWO

Your Excellency, she steps right outside our yard.

CHURCH ACTOR THREE

Most Reverend Cauchon, let in her English vanguard.

CAUCHON

No, wait!
We need a more lasting solution to any presumed plebiscite.

D'ESTIVET

What then to do about Joan of Arc?
Peasant supermaid, heroine of fools.

CHURCH ACTOR THREE

No riots, no armies, no credo, no sainting.

CAUCHON

One thing I'll say —- this Joan's not that bad.

D'ESTIVET

We dare not leave her to her own devices,
Her misguided armies will soon get out of hand.

CHURCH ACTORS

But how can we stop her?
Her glamour increases,
She’s capturing cities; she's topping the trends.

CAUCHON

I see bad things arising.
The crowd-crowned queen, the Word Order would ban.
I see blood and rebranding,
Our jobs outsourced because of one girl.
Blood and rebranding because of one girl.

ALL (inside)

Because, because, because of one girl.

CAUCHON

Our jobs outsourced because of one girl.

ALL (inside)

Because, because, because of one, 'cause of one, 'cause of one girl.

CHURCH ACTOR THREE

What then to do about this Joan mania?

D'ESTIVET

Now how do we deal 
with a shepherdess queen?

CHURCH ACTORS

Where do we start with a Maiden bigger
Than even Charles was 
when Charles was still the VI-th?

CAUCHON

Fools, you have no perception!
The stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high!
We must burn her completely,
So like Charles before her, this Joan of Arc must die.
For the sake of our Mother, Catholic Church, no relics.

ALL (inside)

Must die, must burn, this Joan must burn.

CAUCHON

Like Charles before Charles, this Joan has to die.

ALL (inside)

We must burn her completely, this Maiden must burn to thin dust!
She must burn completely, no proof of her being to everlast!

Let the world turn without you tonight.

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you, and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead, oh.

Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And it's cool, and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet.
Close your eyes, close your eyes
And relax, think of nothing tonight.

KING CHARLES VII

Christ your fine ointment, brand new and exquisite
Should have been saved for a king.
Why has it been wasted? We could have raised maybe

Move while you still rule France!
You'll be lost, and you'll be sad without a kingdom.

JESUS

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead/
Then you'll feel
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in you head-to-feet.
Close your eyes, close your eyes, and relax
Think of nothing but light.

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

Close your eyes, close your eyes, and arise

# Scene 2.2 Lyrics
```
KING CHARLES VII

It seems to me a strange thing, mystifying
That a Christ like you bestows his light on a lowly paysanne like her.

LA HIRE

Hey, cool it, king.

KING CHARLES VII

Yes, I can understand that she is a hero,
But to let her hear you and your saints, that's hardly in your line.
It's not that I object to her toils,
But she doesn't fit in well with what your Church teaches.
It doesn't help us if the Church is inconsistent.
The English only need a small excuse to make all world theirs.

JESUS CHRIST

Who are you to criticise her?
Who are you to despise her?
Leave her, leave her, let her be now.
Leave her, leave her, she's with me now.
If your slate is clean, then you can throw stones.
If your slate is not, then leave her alone.

FOLLOWERS

Hey, Jesus, what do we say?
Hey, Jesus, what do we say?

JESUS CHRIST

I'm amazed that you influencers can be so shallow, thick and slow
There is not a soul among you who knows or cares where I come or go.

FOLLOWERS

No, you're wrong!
You're very wrong!
No, you're wrong!
You're very wrong!
No, you're wrong!

How can you say that?

NAPOLEON

Who is this ghostly maid, appearing in my presence?
Who is this spectral form?

GHOSTLY SOLDIER

It's Joan of Arc,
Queen of France.

NAPOLEON

Ah, so this is Joan of Arc,
I've read about your spark.
You look so small,
Unfit for a war.
I've heard your tale of woes,
But are you she?
The Armored Savioress?

JOAN

Your words, not mine.

NAPOLEON

What do you mean by that?
That is not proper reply.
Je suis l'Empereur du Monde,
Shepherd,
Called Queen of the French.
How can someone in your state be so cool about her fate?
Perplexing circumstance, this silent queen of France.
Since you fought for The Cross, I am surely not your boss.
You're Church's face!
You're Pope's case!

GHOSTLY ARMY

Hey Joan, Hey Joan, Joan of Arc,
Hey Joan, brave heart, our spark will start.
Hey Joan, oh Joan, please make it clear,
You led wars before,
Why are you here?

# Scene 2.5 Lyrics
```
THE POPE

Joan, I am ecstatic to meet you face to face.
You got signs of sainthood all around your case.
Leading armies, hearing voices from on-high.
And some claim you're God-sent, that I must canonize.

So, you are the Maid, you're the Church's SuperMaid.
Operate the change of fate; anoint yourself a saint.
Perform this small feat, make all skeptics retreat.
Come on, Supermaiden.

Joan, you can't conceive the stir you've made in Rome.
You're on everyone's lips, from pauper to the dome.
What a tale if it turns out false, my dear.
But I believe you could sway the critics, have no fear.

So, you are the Maid, you're Church's SuperMaid.
Show me you're Heaven's tool; walk unburned through fiery fuel.
If you pass through the flame, holy I will make your name.
Come on, Maid of Orléans.

I ask you as I would of any saint-to-be,
What gift from God was placed on you where all the world can see?
I am waiting, as the Church's guiding hand.
Awaiting proof that you're apart from those in the normy band.

So, if you are the Maid, the proclaimed Joan of Arc,
Fill the github with your deeds, heal world hunger and all needs.
Or are tales all gone wrong? Joan, why make us wait so long?
Oh! Come on, you Supermaiden.

Hey! Doesn't Church Triumphant scare you, Joan?
Oh, Venerable Joan of Arc?
You're a trademark, not a saint.
Proof is what we want, not quaint.

Keep her away,
Next audience: next century!
Speak no more, Joan of,
Silence, Joan of,
Quiet, you Venerable Blessed Saint Joan of Arc!
Leave our records!
Your standard leads nowhere, Joan,
Erase her from our archives!

# Scene 2.6 Lyrics

```
NAPOLEON

And so the queen is once again my guest.
And why is this? Was The Pope unimpressed?

CAUCHON

We turn to history to seal our judgement.
We have no way to pain her after death.
We need her totally forgotten.
It's all you have to do.
We need her forgotten.
It's all you have to do.

NAPOLEON

Talk to me Joan of Arc.
You have been brought here
Manacled, burned by your own people.
Do you have the first idea why you deserve it?
Listen Savioress of France,
Where are your saved?
Look at me. Am I saved?

JOAN

I have no savings in the world.
I'm through.
There may be something saved for me somewhere.
If you only knew.

NAPOLEON

Then you are a savioress?

JOAN

It's you who say I am.
I look for truth and find that I get grilled.

NAPOLEON

But what is truth?
Is truth a changing law?
We both have truths.
Are mine the same as yours?

FRENCH MOB

Forget of her! Erase her deeds!

NAPOLEON

What do you mean?
You'd forget your savioress?

FRENCH MOB

We have no savior but our own selves!

NAPOLEON

She's done no wrong.
No, not the slightest thing.

FRENCH MOB

We have no savior but our own selves!
Erase her!

NAPOLEON

What is this new respect for self?
This was imported from New Orleans.
Who is this Saint? Why is she different?
You choose bad leaders by the sackful.

FRENCH MOB

We need her edited out,
It's all you have to do.
We need her erased,
It's all you have to do.

NAPOLEON

Talk to me, Joan of Arc.
Look at your Joan of Arc.
I'll agree she's mad.
Ought to be re-trialed,
But that is not a reason to erase her.
She's a sad little girl.
Not a Saviour or Christ.
Not even a liar,
I need a crime!

FOLLOWERS

Erase her!

NAPOLEON

Behold a Maiden,
Behold your shattered Queen.

FRENCH MOB

We have no saviour but US!

NAPOLEON

You hypocrites,
You hate US more than her.

FRENCH MOB

We have no saviour but The US!
Erase her!

NAPOLEON

I see no reason. I find no evil.
This girl is harmless, so why does she upset you?
She's just misguided, thinks she's important,
But to keep you vultures happy I shall edit her.

FRENCH MOB

Erase her! Erase her!

(Thirty-nine edits, Napoleon counts)
NAPOLEON

Where are you from Joan?
What do you want Joan?
Tell me.
You've got to be careful.
You could be erased soon,
Could well be.
Why do you not speak when
I hold your eternity in my hands?
How can you stay quiet?
I don't believe you understand.

JOAN

You have nothing in your hands.
Any power you have, comes to you from far beyond.
Everything is fixed, and you can't change it.

NAPOLEON

You're a fool Joan of Arc.
How can I help you?

FRENCH MOB

Napoleon, Erase her!
For all posterity.
You have a duty
To document French virtues, so erase her!
For all posterity.
You'll be demoted.
You'll be deported. Erase her!

For all posterity.
You have a duty

You'll be demoted.
You'll be deported. Erase her!

Don't let me stop your great self-destruction.
Be forgotten if you want to, you misguided martyr.
I wash my hands of your demolition.
Be forgotten if you want to, you innocent soul!

# Scene 2.7 Lyrics
```
JESUS

I know how to lead her.
What to do, how to move her.
She's been changed, yes really changed.
In these past few hundred years, since she is here,
She seems like someone else.
I don't know how to take this.
I don't see why he moves me.
She's a girl. She's just a girl.
And I've led so many girl souls before,
In very many ways,
She's just one more.
Should I keep her down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of might,
Let my Heavens light?
I never thought I'd come to this.
What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
She loves me so.
I never thought I'd come to this.
What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.
I'd turn my head. I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know.
She trusts me so.
I know her so.
I guide her so.

There must be legions upon legions
Screaming love and more for you.
And every one of all these legions
Would do whatever you ask them to.

Keep them yelling their devotion,
But add a touch of hate of English band.
You will rise to a greater stature,
We will win ourselves a stand.

You'll get the might and the light
For ever and ever and ever
You'll get the might and the light
For ever and ever and ever

You'll get the might and the light
For ever and ever and ever
You'll get the might and light, you'll get to be a saint
For ever and ever and ever

Forever Amen! Amen! Amen!

Neither you, la Hire, nor the legions,
Nor the English, nor the Church,

Nor the priests, nor Google search,
Nor redeemed Orléans itself
Understand what might is,
Understand what light is,
Understand at all,
Understand at all.
If you knew all that I knew, my poor France,
You'd see the truth, but you close your eyes.
But you close your eyes.
While you crave, your troubles are many, poor France.
To conquer greed, you only have to give.
You only have to give.

```
A world without heroes
Is like a world without sun
You can't look up to anyone
Without heroes

And a world without heroes
Is like a never ending race
Is like a time without a place
A pointless thing, devoid of grace

Where you don't know what you're after
Or if something's after you
And you don't know why you don't know
In a world without heroes

In a world without dreams
Things are no more than they seem
And a world without heroes
Is like a bird without wings
Or a bell that never rings
Just a sad and useless thing

Where you don't know what you're after
Or if something's after you
And you don't know why you don't know


In a world without heroes
There's nothing to be
It's no place for me
